description: Trains of 5, 10, or 15 pulses all at 1 Hz. Cells were electroporated
  by a train of 5, 10, or 15 unipolar 600 ns pulses (0 percent) or bipolar 600 + 600
  ns pulses (50 percent) at 1 Hz. 50% represents the second pulse's amplitude in relation
  to the first pulse's amplitude. 0% represents a unipolar pulse, where no second
  pulse was applied. The electrodes were two parallel stainless-steel cylinders, 1.5
  mm in diameter and 3 mm apart. Supported by NIH 1R21EY034258
